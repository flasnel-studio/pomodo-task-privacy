    <p>Effective Date: July 13, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PomodoTask ("we", "our", or "app") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> PomodoTask is designed to function entirely on your device. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tasks you create</li>
        <li>Pomodoro session data</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Automatic Data Collection:</strong> PomodoTask does not automatically collect any data from your device. All data is stored locally on your device using secure local storage.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    
    <p>The information stored locally on your device is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the core functionality of the app (task management and time tracking)</li>
        <li>To display your productivity statistics</li>
        <li>To maintain your app preferences</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    
    <p>PomodoTask does not share any of your data with third parties. All data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data stored locally on your device. However, please be aware that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can delete tasks, clear session history, or uninstall the app to remove all data.</p>
